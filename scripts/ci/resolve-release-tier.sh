# Resolve the release tier from an environment-prefixed tag, and REFUSE when the tagged
# commit is not contained in that tier's branch.
#
# Tags are `dev/v1.2.3`, `test/v1.2.3`, `prod/v1.2.3`. The tier is the prefix, and it is the
# prefix rather than a suffix for three reasons:
# `v1.2.3-test` is a semver PRE-release and sorts BELOW `v1.2.3`, which would invert
# createCpDeployment's "refuses an older version" guard; `v1.2.3+test` is illegal in a Docker
# tag; and a GitHub tag filter's `*` does not match `/`, so `tags: ['v*.*.*']` cannot
# accidentally catch a prefixed tag and publish it as if it were tier-agnostic.
#
# WHY THE CONTAINMENT CHECK IS THE POINT. A tag has never been attached to a branch in git —
# `git tag prod/v1.2.3 && git push origin prod/v1.2.3` from a feature branch is a valid push,
# and every release workflow in this org would have built and published it. The tag names an
# environment; nothing made the tag's COMMIT belong to that environment. This is the whole
# gate: `prod/v1.2.3` must be reachable from `origin/prod` or the run fails.
#
# It fails LOUDLY rather than skipping. A quiet no-op is the failure mode this codebase keeps
# producing — a check that has never been observed refusing is not passing, it is unproven —
# and a skipped release looks identical to a release nobody cut.
#
# Run resolve-release-tier.test.sh to see it refuse. That test builds a real git repository
# with real branches and asserts BOTH directions, because a case expecting silence passes for
# the wrong reason exactly as easily as it passes for the right one.
#
# Usage (CI):   scripts/ci/resolve-release-tier.sh              # reads GITHUB_REF / GITHUB_SHA
# Usage (test): scripts/ci/resolve-release-tier.sh <ref> <sha>
#
# Requires the full history: actions/checkout must set `fetch-depth: 0`. With the default
# shallow clone the merge-base is not in the graph and the check would refuse a valid tag.
#
# Writes `tier` and `version` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT when set, and always prints them as
# `tier=<t>` / `version=<v>` on stdout so the script is usable outside Actions.

# `${1-...}` and not `${1:-...}`: an argument explicitly passed as the empty string means an

# made the empty-ref case unreproducible inside Actions -- there it read the runner's own
